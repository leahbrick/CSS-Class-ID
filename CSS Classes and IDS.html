>A place I would like to visit.</h2>
<p>If I could go anywhere in the world it would be Hell, Michigan. You can be mayor for a day because Elijah Daniel
    bought the town and offered this experience. That way, I can be mayor of Hell for a day, which would be an absolute
    dream.</p>

<!-- I can't wait to go to Hell -->

<h2 class="person-description"
>A person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2>
<p>Someone I admire is my boyfriend's mom, Dr. Lynne Gibeau. She is an OBGYN and the breadwinner of her family. Her job
    often requires her to work 24+ hour shifts as she preforms complete surgeries and brings new life into the world.
    She always wanted to be a mother <span class="important-point">but didn't let stop her from aspiring to something big.</span> She's an amazing, attentive
    mother and a dedicated, selfless doctor. She has inspired me a lot over the years.</p>
